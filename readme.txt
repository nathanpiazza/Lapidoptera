Project Lapidoptera: Vision Statement
-------------------------------------------


What is Lapidoptera?

Lapidoptera is an open source content management system (CMS) focusing on the development and distribution of content types, or content formats, such as event reviews, business reviews, product reviews, recipes, image series, webisodes, top X lists, etc. 

Lapidoptera's development is motivated by the recognition that web content has outgrown the one-size-fits-all blog post format, and that the lack of a wider variety of structured content types, both on the publishing system back end, and in syndication, is holding web content back.


Tools

1. JQuery, Javascript
2. Python
3. Django (and South) or Pylons


Values

1. Open Source.
2. Convention over configuration.
3. Support content authors, and respect their needs.



Goals

1. To promote the fluency and richness of web-syndicated content by extending the range of content types that are easily and commonly exchanged and published.

2. To leverage, support, and extend the work of the microformat community, including the promotion of awareness of microformats, so that more software supports syndication of a wider variety of microformats, and more users demand that support.

3. To make it easy to publish and "theme" a wide array of web publication "genres" (foodie journal, arts magazine, project development notes, wedding scrapbook, slash fiction clearinghouse, travelog, child-rearing diary, crafting tips site), which are built up from specific content types.

4. Use best of breed practices in UI and library/API design.
